title: "MIRA read assembly"
---

To obtain the mtDNA from *P. rubi* and *P. fragariae* we want to use [MITObim](http://github.com/chrishah/MITObim):

> The MITObim procedure (mitochondrial baiting and iterative mapping) represents a highly efficient approach to assembling novel mitochondrial genomes of non-model organisms directly from total genomic DNA derived NGS reads. Labor intensive long-range PCR steps prior to sequencing are no longer required. MITObim is capable of reconstructing mitochondrial genomes without the need of a reference genome of the targeted species by relying solely on (a) mitochondrial genome information of more distantly related taxa or (b) short mitochondrial barcoding sequences (seeds), such as the commonly used cytochrome-oxidase subunit 1 (COI), as a starting reference.

The script is performing three steps and iteratively repeating them:

  1. Deriving reference sequence from previous mapping assembly
  
  2. In silico baiting using the newly derived reference
  
  3. Previously fished reads are mapped to the newly derived reference leading to an extension of the reference sequence. 

It requires *[MIRA V 4.0](http://mira-assembler.sourceforge.net/)* to generate the assemblies.

##Step 1: Mapping the reads to the *P. sojae* genome using MIRA


**Reference:** 
  
  * *P. sojae* genome [`NC_009385.1`](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_009385.1)
    * Location in cluster: `/nfs0/Grunwald_Lab/home/tabimaj/genomes_rf/mtdna/sojae_mtdna.fa`
**Reads:**

  * *P. fragariae*: `/nfs0/Grunwald_Lab/home/tabimaj/genomes_rf/mtdna/Pfrag/cleandata_500_1.fq.gz` & `/nfs0/Grunwald_Lab/home/tabimaj/genomes_rf/mtdna/Pfrag/cleandata_500_2.fq.gz`

* *P. rubi*: `/nfs0/Grunwald_Lab/home/tabimaj/genomes_rf/mtdna/Prub/cleandata_500_1.fq.gz` & `/nfs0/Grunwald_Lab/home/tabimaj/genomes_rf/mtdna/Pfrag/cleandata_500_2.fq.gz`
  
**Other requirements:**
  
  * MIRA `manifest.comf` file (the *P. fragariae* version shown here):
  
```bash
  
#manifest file for basic mapping assembly with illumina data using MIRA 4
